			<h1>Issues in A.I.</h1>
		</div>
		<div class="introduction">
			<p>A.I. has recently become very prevalent. More and more people are starting to implent A.I. in to their lives, wether they know it or not. Because of this, ethical concerns about its use arise.</p>

			<h2>Common Concerns About A.I.</h2>
		</div>
			<div class="issues">
				<h3>Is A.I. good or bad?</h3>
			</div>
					<div class="answers">
						<li>Most people said it depends. It is created to help us, with good intentions, but in the wrong hands it can be bad. Examples would be A.I. would be great in detecting possible tumors or cancerous cells in our body, but it could also be used to create deep fakes and spread misinformation. It also might take away some repetitive jobs but it will also create new ones.</li>
						<li>A.I. could also make humans dependent on it, lessening our ability for critical thinking.</li>
						<li>The use of A.I. can cause the loss of jobs</li>
					</div>
					<div class="issues">
						<h3>Will A.I. replace humans?</h3>
						</div>
					<div class="answers">
						<li>No, not really. Most people said no. It might take some repetitive jobs, but humans still have to be there for maintenance, quality control, etc. A.I. also doesn't have empathy or human emotions which may be needed for some jobs.</li>
						<li>It also lacks experiences that only humans can obtain, one example of this was in architecture wherein it lacks accuracy. It cannot envision structures to scale based on what a human imagines it to be. It also cannot make accurate predictions on trends as the randomness of memes could impact how a business can use it for marketing.</li>
